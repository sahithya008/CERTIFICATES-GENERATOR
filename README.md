# 🎓 Student Certificate Generator System  

🚀 **A Flask-based web application that automates student certificate generation** — making processes like Bonafide, Course Completion, and Fee Structure certificates faster, paperless, and error-free.

## 💡 Overview  

Educational institutions often issue student certificates manually — which is time-consuming and prone to errors.  
This system automates the **entire process** using **Flask**, integrating student data from Excel or a database, validating eligibility, and generating professional **PDF certificates instantly.**
